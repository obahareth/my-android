## Summary

I laid out folders on my home screen based on the word that pops up in my mind when I want to do them. My main screen is for the stuff I use most of the time, and my secondary screen is for things I don't use as often.

## Hardware


### Phone

#### [Samsung Galaxy S10](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/)

- Great battery life.
- Great performance.
- Good camera.
- Actually supported in my region (My previous Pixel 3 broke down and had all kinds of hardware failures and no matter how much I tried, Google wouldn't replace it (even though it's under warranty) because of my region).

### Headphones

#### [Bose QuietComfort 35 II](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html)

- Amazing noise cancellation, helps me get peace and quiet in noisy places.

- Great battery life.

## Launcher, Wallpaper, and Icon Pack
